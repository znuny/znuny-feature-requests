## Suggesting Features

Many of the features in Znuny come from community recommendations.

We welcome any ideas about how to make the software better. Unless there is an overwhelming demand for a feature, it might not get implemented.

Before posting, be kind to those monitoring this repository.

**Read:**

Use the [documentation](https://doc.znuny.org/manual/index.html)! Be kind to your surroundings and the authors who take joy in writing documentation to help you. You might find just the feature you are looking for and save time.

If not, you'll have learned something on the way.

**Discuss:**

Make sure that you have discussed this issue with the community and us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/rffPsa89) or the [user forums](https://community.znuny.org/) first.

**Create a Feature Request(Issue):**

Create an issue including as much information as possible to your proposal. The list below is the minimum requirement.

1. **User story:** What are you trying to accomplish in specific terms?

A good users story might be: "As an administrator, I would like to clear the system log without leaving the system log panel in the administration area."

2. **Situation:** What is the current state or hurdle preventing your success story?

Using the example above: "I only have access to the web-frontend and to troubleshoot an issue I must be able to clear the logs without access to a command line to make sure the issue fixed is no longer occurring."

3. **Desired Goal:** How do you expect the software to change for the positive?

In our current example, a goal may be simple: "Please provide me with a button to clear the logs."

Please be very specific in your request. The less ambiguous a request is, the higher the chance of acceptance.

4. **Impact:** - Think about how others see it

Your change impacts other users.

### Feature Request Issue Handling

We only discuss new features and possible implementation designs in the [issues](https://github.com/znuny/znuny-feature-requests/issues/) area. Show your support for a feature using GitHub reactions. Add meaningful details to enrich the feature definition only. Please do not comment with "+1" as it creates unnecessary noise (e-mails, notifications, etc.). Be thoughtful!

Please refrain from submitting a pull request to the [Znuny](https://github.com/znuny/Znuny) repository until there is a consensus here. In this way, you can avoid putting in unnecessary work. Once the need for the feature is determined, proceed with a pull request as found in the [developer manual](https://doc.znuny.org/manual/index.html).

1. For reasons described [above](#suggesting-features), building a feature as an add-on can be preferable. Requests tagged with `add-on` `help-wanted` are identified as incompatible with the framework and closed.
>
>- If the feature could be built as an add-on and serves a niche need, you are encouraged to package it.
>- If the underlying issue could be better solved by existing technology, we encourage you to seek help in the [Discord Developer Channel](https://discord.gg/ZMeu8AR5).
>
2. The community works with the requester and others to build a specification for the feature and update the issue description accordingly.
3. Finally, if accepted, the `confirmed` label is added.
